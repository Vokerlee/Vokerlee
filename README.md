<h1 align="center">Hi <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px">, I am Roman Glaz! </h1>
<h3 align="center">MIPT Student | System Programmer </h3>

Now I am a 2st year MIPT student (Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology) of FRCT (Faculty of Radio Engineering and Computer Technologies)

Here are some of the most pithy and important projects:

## Main projects

* Shooter game, based on 3D simulation (ray-casting):
    * [Ardua Shooter](https://github.com/Vokerlee/ArduaShooter)
* Programming languages, based on nCPU (see below):
    * [CMM or C-- language](https://github.com/Vokerlee/CMM-Language)
    * [SHUE Language](https://github.com/Vokerlee/SHUE-Language)
* Compiler, based on CMM language:
	* [CMM Compiler](https://github.com/Vokerlee/CMM-Compiler)
* A clear and tough guide how to create executable file:
    * [How to create EXE file](https://github.com/Vokerlee/Create-EXE-in-20-minutes)


## Less significant, but still interesting projects
* Own assembly language and CPU for it (nCPU):
    * [nCPU](https://github.com/Vokerlee/Compiler-technologies/tree/master/5.%20nCPU)
* Derivative calculator:
	* [Differentiator](https://github.com/Vokerlee/Compiler-technologies/tree/master/8.%20Differentiator)
* Alarm-clock, written for STM32 microcontrollers:
    * [Alarm-clock (STM32)](https://github.com/Vokerlee/Alarm-Clock-STM32)
* Simple graphics editor:
    * [Graphics editor](https://github.com/Vokerlee/Graphics-editor)
* [Hash-table optimization](https://github.com/Vokerlee/Assembly/tree/main/5.2.%20Hash-table's%20optimization)

Also there are a lot of other funny projects, they can be found in repositories.
